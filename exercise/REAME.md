# Concepts in Reinforcement Learning


## Bandits 
The Multi-Armed Bandit problem is the simplest setting of reinforcement learning. Suppose that a gambler faces a row of slot machines (bandits) on a casino. Each one of the K machines has a probability Î¸k of providing a reward to the player. Thus, the player has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them, in order to maximize his long-term cumulative reward.
